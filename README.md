_AWS CDK patterns_

This repo contains a set of AWS CDK patterns packaged as functions.

The aim is to make it easy to put together typical infrastructure building blocks that can be reused (and/or tweaked) across projects.

The name 'scloud' means 'simple cloud', but could equally mean other things. These patterns are designed to be basic and not finely configurable, on the basis that keeping things standad, simple, even a bit stupid (take that as far into the S territory as you like) is a good way to get things done and get on with life.

If you're not intimately interested in infrastructure, want to do it well, but don't really want to make it your passion in life then scloud might be what you need.

I use it to store chunks of reference code I need and use each time I build a new service.
